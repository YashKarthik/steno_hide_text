# Stenography using Python

#### Text steganography is a mechanism of hiding secret text message inside another text or image using the image as cover.

### Files:
                      1)steno.py:python script to hide text in another image OR decode another stenographed image
                      2)stenoIMG.png:image in which is used as cover.
                      3)Out.png:image output after the text is covered.
                      
### Usage:
#### Run it through your IDE and then:

                      It will ask you whether you wanna encode or decode.
                        ●If you chose encode it'll ask you for the file to use as cover.
                            1)Then it'll ask for text to encode.
                            2)It'll ask you for the name of the file which'll have the encoded text.
                            3)The output file will look ditto same but it'll have the encoded text.
                        ●If you chose decode:
                            1)It'll ask for the stenoghraphed file.
                            2)It'll decode the file and print the text in the terminal.
                            
                            
### User Input:
                        1)Choice of encoding / decoding.
                        2)Text to encode.
